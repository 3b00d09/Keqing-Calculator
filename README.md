# Keqing-Calculator
A simple Keqing calculator to help you figure out what set of Artifacts / Weapons will net you the most damage. 

For any questions or feedback feel free to message me on discord, 3b00d_09#2235 (DMs open to people with mutual servers).

If you are familiar with [Genshin Optimizer](frzyc.github.io/genshin-optimizer), this tool is a meant to serve as an alternative to people who can't use the Genshin Optimizer (mostly Mobile and Console players).

# How to Use

The calculator is fairly simple to use, you input your character stats & equipment, and it will return to you your damage output. That's it. There are however a few things
to keep in mind:

- Enemy Level and Electro / Physical Resistance are assumed to be 90 and 10% respectively. Meaning if you fight enemies with different Level / Resistances, the calculator 
won't show you accurate numbers. However, it will still compare the two sets to you accurately so keep an eye on the "difference" percentage. 
- There is no option to input Team Buffs at the moment. This is purely Solo Keqing damage. 
- Infusion type is the same as Goblet type; Phys Goblet will be Phys Normal / Charged attacks and Electro Goblet will be Electro Normal / Charged attacks.
- Weapon Choice only matters for Weapons that dynamically give buffs, and weapons with buffs that can't be inputted (The Black Sword).
For example, Mistsplitter will give you different Damage Bonuses based on different stacks. Lion's Roar will give you a Damage Bonus if you are fighting Enemies that 
are inflicted with Electro. Weapons that give static buffs, like Jade Cutter, do not need to be inputted, and you can just click on "Other". 
- The above applies to Artifacts as well.
- "Total Rotation Damage" is 5 Normals, 5 Charged Attacks, 1 Skill cast, 1 Skill recast, and 1 Elemental Burst cast. Weapon Passive included for Aquila Favonia.
- Currently there is no way to add Team Buffs. This is pure solo Keqing damage. Team Buffs will be added in the future.
